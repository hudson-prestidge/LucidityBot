# LucidityBot

current issues:

it's possible for users to send messages longer than the bot can parse. the bot will just throw an error and not store that message.
changing the type to the postgres 'text' data type will possibly fix this? look into it


want to add nightbot's [touser] functionality
want to add moobot's league api functionality so we can pull in rank/runes
want to add mooobot's latest youtube url functionality (youtube api?) and current time functionality
